Invitation for deep dialectical thinking for software engineers

Software engineers do a lot of thinking, and would often benefit from having a framework for self-reflective practice.
I've applied dialectics and the Dialectical Thought Form Framework (DTF) to software engineering and am inviting other
software engineers to join me in thinking cohorts.
By applying DTF, an individual develops cognitively and unlocks new ways of conceptualizing knowledge.
This is more than just knowledge acquisition.
Beyond learning what to think, this unlocks new ways of how to think, and increases thought fluidity.
By extension, this prepares engineers for more strategic senior positions.

The dialectic cohorts operate  free of charge, and each individual is both teacher and student.
We reflect on our thinking while writing software and simultaneously identifying structures in our thinking called
thought-forms.
We each discover our unique preferred thought-forms and share them with the group for our collective benefit.

The approach is backed by a long tradition and body of research by Laske, Basseches, Kegan, Hegel, Bhaskar,
and others.
