\section{Conclusion}

Historically, engineers have developed themselves on their jobs in a horizontal direction using skill acquisition.
Joining a dialectic engineering cohort, engineers can develop vertically and unlock cognitive tooling to enter into
more strategic roles with longer time horizons.
This enlarges the range of responsibilities an engineer can take on from simple feature development, to entering into
deep customer discussions, and considering implications decades into the future.

In the past, these skills have been intuitively acquired and passed on through change encounters with cognitively
higher functioning individuals.
Using a dialectic engineering approach, once formalized, it can be more fairly shared with a larger audience.
